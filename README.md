# Memory Game Project

This is a game in which your memory will be challenged!  You will interact dynamically with 16 cards in a square.  It is your task to match them and complete the game with the best possible statistics!  It will grade your performance with stars, time you, and count your moves!  Good luck!

## Instructions

To get started, download this repo and run the index.html file in your browser.  You will be presented with a table of 16 cards.  You can click two at a time, and after a short delay, they will turn back over.  Use your memory to complete the game as best as you can!  Once you have a match, they will permanently stick flipped over.

## Dependencies

While making this game, I created the majority of the javascript code.  Some of the code used in this project was provided and some of the code was written referencing online resources:

1. Starter code, including the index.html and app.css files were provided by Udacity from https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game
2. Font-awesome icons were used from https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.6.1/css/font-awesome.min.css
3. I heavily relied on the modal-box example from https://matthewcranford.com/memory-game-walkthrough-part-7-making-a-modal/ to enable the "game over" functionality. 
4. Card shuffle function that is called in the app.js file is from http://stackoverflow.com/a/2450976
5. Google font "coda" was used within the code from https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda
6. Mike Wales' webinar was used to help guide the dynamic process of creating the cards with javascript from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rUH-sEs68Y
