# Memory Game Project

This is a game in which your memory will be challenged!  You will interact dynamically with 16 cards in a square.  It is your task to match them and complete the game with the best possible statistics!  It will grade your performance with stars, time you, and count your moves!  Good luck!

## Instructions

To get started, download this repo and run the index.html file in your browser.  You will be presented with a table of 16 cards.  You can click two at a time, and after a short delay, they will turn back over.  Use your memory to complete the game as best as you can!  Once you have a match, they will permanently stick flipped over.
